## *Description:*
A 3D printed case in the sytle of Gilbert Rohde Model 6356 for Herman Miller.

In the as-built version of this project, I'm using the free downloadable Deco typefont from Nick Curtis, called "Dubba Dubba". If you like Nick's work, please contribute a few $$ at: http://www.1001fonts.com/search.html?search=dubba+dubba&x=10&y=6
